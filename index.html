            <h2>Raspberry PI Computer</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                This is a Raspberry PI Computer, and it is an ARM
                Single Board Computer(SBC). Usually, people use it 
                to make fun projects or just to tinker with it, but
                for me, it is my Personal Computer. I got my first
                Raspberry PI 4 when I was 12 for my Birthday and then
                got a Raspberry PI 5 from my friend Frank.
            </p>

            <h3>Operating System and Applications</h3>
            <p>
                The Raspberry PI runs Raspberry PI OS which is based on
                Debian Linux, so I use linux on a day to day basis. The browser
                I use on here is the open-source chromium browser.
                The app store I use is the Pi-apps store. For games,
                PPSSPP, Retropie and also Minecraft is installed. This
                computer is pretty powerful and I love it. 
            </p>

            <h3>Processor and Graphics</h3>
            <p>
                The Raspberry PI is based on the Advanced RISC Machine(ARM)
                architecture, so a lot of software that run on PCs won't run.
                The Soc include a quad-core arm cortex-a76 along with videocore
                VII graphics. The default clock speed is 2.4Ghz on the cpu and 
                800Mhz on the gpu. Both can be overclocked.

            <h2>Arduino Bluetooth Car</h2>
            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p>
                The project I am have created is a bluetooth controlled
                car using arduino and can be controlled via android-only
                app. I've always been really interested in Remote
                Controlled Cars and so this was an amazing project for me.
            </p>
            <h3>Making the Project</h3>
            <p>I first printed out the rectangular chasis that I have designed
                and hot-glued 4 Geared motors and added copper wires to them.
                Then, I used double-sided tape to stick the Arduino UNO with 
                the L293D Shield and the HC-05 module onto the chasis. Afterwards, 
                I connected all the wires and uploaded the code to the Arduino.
                Paired the blueooth module and the car works amazing. 
            </p>

            <h3>Subprojects</h3>
            <h4>Solar Panel Car</h4>
            <p>Basically the same project, but with added solar panels. This means the car can run purely on energy from the sun. This increases the weight and
                bulkiness of the machine, but also makes it a moving power bank and it also looks really cool!
            </p>

            <h4>Obstacle Detecting Car</h4>
            <p>Again, built upon the main bluetooth car project, but this time it adds a ultrasonic sensor to detect objects and their distance. The sensor runs at a
                sound frequency of 20Ghz, making it inaudible to humans. The sensor is placed in the front of the car and it constantly detects things in front. If it finds
                anything within 20cm, it'll immediately stop the car!
            </p>

            <h2>Ender 3 Pro 3D Printer</h2>
            <h3>Discovery</h3>
            <p>
                A 3D printer is something I always wanted and dreamed of having. Last year, I fulfilled my dream. Before we even moved to the USA, my dad
                found this and brought it home. I carefully examined it and started working on it step by step. The picture shows when I'd just cleaned it up
                and found out it turns on!
            </p>
            <img class="printer" src="Pic10.JPG">

            <h3>Repair</h3>
            <p>After more hard work and persuation, my mom finally allowed me to buy a metal extruder for the station, after which I was able to test out the
                movements of the 3D printer. This was when I found out how to use the UI to control the printer.
            </p>
            <img class="printer" src="Pic3.jpeg">

            <h3>Outcomes</h3>
            <p>The 3D Printer has been one of the best and most expensive tools that I own, and it has helped me in countless projects. I have used it to make 
                the body of the Arduino Bluetooth Car project, the shade for the DHT11 Temperatue and Humidity sensor in the Weather Station project, and
                countless others. I have also made a lot of toys and mini sculptures using it for myself and my friends and family.

        <div class="sec-04">
            <h2>Weather Station</h2>
            <h3>Specifications</h3>
            <p>The Weather Station has a arduino rain sensor along with a DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor. The Nodemcu Esp8266 reads these data and sends
                them to the blynk IOT server. There, I can login from anywhere in the world and get the readings. But, you have to create a device on blynk to
                get an Auth Token and give wifi credintials for it to connect to the internet. As long the internet is on, it'll send data to my blynk dashboard.
            </p>
            <img class="wthstation" src="Pic5.jpeg">

            <h3>Functionality</h3>
            <p>The Weather Station sends data to my blynk dashboard at a heartbeat of 2 seconds. There are 3 gauges, the first one shows Temperature
                in celcius, the second one humidity in percentage, and the last but not least rain one gives me rain in percentage based on the amount
                of rain on the sensor.
            </p>
            <img class="wthstation1" src="Pic8.png">

            <h3>Structure</h3>
            <p>The main body of the Weather Station which is basically a plastic box that houses the sensitive components and the Nodemcu Esp8266
                coumputer/microcontroller to protect them from the elements. The DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor and the rain sensor are kept outside
                so that they can gather data, and a micro usb cable provides power for the wall outlet.

            <h2>Arduino Bluetooth Boat</h2>
            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>The project was originally inspired from the Arduino Bluetooth Car, as it has a lot of the same components and uses the same app
                to control it. However, it doesn't use geared motors but normal D.C. motors along with propellars.
            </p>
            <H3>Building</H3>
            <p>The electronics are almost the same, but uses 2 normal D.C. motors instead of geared ones. The electronics are placed in a chasis
                made from a food container, and a blueooth module is also added for communication. It uses the same app the blueooth car uses.
